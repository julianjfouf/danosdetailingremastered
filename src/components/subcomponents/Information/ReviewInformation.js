      "Fernando did a great job. He was very thorough with his work and incredibly professional in the manner in which he explained all necessary steps. He paint corrected and ceramic coated my car - it has a deep glossy shine and the swirls/scratches are now practically imperceptible. Thanks Fernando!",

      "Did the full interior service for my suv. Had cooking oil spilled a few months ago which stained everywhere in the trunk. Had water and food/drink stains on the seats as well and middle console had residue. He was able to get all of the oil out and everything else as well. It was a quick job, about 3 hours and the inside of the car looks so much better than ever!",

      "I brought my minivan in for an interior vacuum/shampoo and what a fantastic job. I wasn't sure if he would be able to get some of the stains out, but he did. I was worried about lingering smells from the cleaning products yet there was nothing. I called to set up my appointment and after that I was able to stay in contact via text. What a great option to have. Thank you for the great service!",

      "Dano is a best detailer in town, very flexible for availability and high quality performance. I gave my Hyundai Sonata 2015, with so much dirt and spots on seats, to my surprise, car looks completely new, as if it stains were not there. I am fan of this detailers and planning to give other two cars here. I highly recommend this for anyone in Tracy and nearby areas.",

      "Fernando did an excellent job on my Corvette. The picture shows the shine. The paint is smooth after he used a clay bar to get out the contaminates. I will be using Fernando again.",

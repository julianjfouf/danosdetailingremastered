      question: "What is Paint Correction?",
      answer:
        "Paint correction is the process of removing imperfections from your vehicle’s paint, such as swirl marks, scratches, and oxidation, to restore its shine and clarity. Dano's Detailing offers professional paint correction services and buffin in Mountain House, Ca and the surrounding areas.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between a wax and paint correction?",
      answer:
        "A wax does not remove any swirls or scratches from your paint. It only hides the very light swirls and can be completed in a few hours. Paint correction actually removes the swirls in your paint. This is what makes the paint shine like crazy. It also takes a substantial amount of time and energy to complete. Usually one or two full days (depending on size, condition, and desired results).",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the paint correction last?",
      answer:
        `After the paint is corrected, the next phase is maintenance. It’s just like training your pet to sit on command. You don’t just teach them once and think they’ll know it forever. You have to continually train and repeat the commands. It’s the same with paint correction. You have to properly (and routinely) wash and dry your vehicle moving forward to maintain the swirl-free finish of your paint. If not, you’re back to square one.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer Ceramic Coatings?",
      answer:
        "We sure do! This is a fantastic option to protect your paint from the weather. You can read more about our ceramic coatings here in Mountain House.  You can also stay with the more traditional wax or sealant.",
    },

  "ceramic coating": [
    {
      question: "Can I wash my car after the coating is installed?",
      answer:
        "Once the coating is applied, the vehicle should not get wet for the first 48 hours so it can fully cure. After that, we advise our customers to not wash their vehicle for the first two weeks. The first wash after we apply the ceramic coating is free to you so we can check how the coating is holding up.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can the Ceramic Coatings replace my clear coat?",
      answer:
        "If your paint is chipping and fading due to clear coat failure, the only option to fix that is a repaint. A ceramic coating will not be able to help.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will the Ceramic Coating protect against rocks and chips?",
      answer:
        "No, there are common misconcpetions about ceramic coatings. They will not protect the paint from rock chips or make the car scratch proof, it will be a long lasting and durable protection and gloss that bonds to the paint and leave a long lasting hydrophobic layer making it easy to clean.",
    },
  ],
  "exterior detailing": [
    {
      question: "How long does a wax last?",
      answer: "It all depends how you store your car. If it’s garaged at work and at home 80% of the time, then it will last much longer. A general rule of thumb would be 2-3 months depending on maintenance.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does this remove scratches from my paint?",
      answer: "Applying a wax will hide the micro-light swirls and scratches in your paint. They’re essentially “filled in” with the wax which creates more shine. So technically it does hide the really light scratches, but it does not actually remove any of them.\n\nNonetheless, your paint will look much glossier because the wax creates a more “flat” surface.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does this include buffing or polishing?",
      answer: "No, this is solely an exterior thorough washing and waxing of the vehicle. If you would like any polishing, this would be done under paint correction services. With any questions, feel free to reach out and contact us!",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you need access to water?",
      answer: "If we are working at your home location, then yes a water spigot within 50ft of the vehicle is needed.",
    },
  ],
  "interior detailing": [
    {
      question: "How long will this service take?",
      answer: "It all comes down to the condition of the vehicle. Generally speaking, it can take between 2 to 5 hours to complete. We’ve worked on coupes that have taken 4 hours due to the condition being bad. On the other hand, we’ve completed an SUV in 2.5 hours since it was well-kept.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I smell chemicals in my car once done?",
      answer: "Absolutely not! That would be terrible. We do not use harsh chemicals on your interior. By the time we’re done, you’ll have a clean-dry car.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you remove every stain? ",
      answer: "Due to the nature of stains and the material it’s on, some stains will come off better than others. We have extensive knowledge and experience (combined with a bunch of tools and products) to handle most situations. But even with all that, some stains won’t come out all the way.",
    },
